# Text Animation

This is a java personal project that takes an image file or a directory that contains a list of images as input and output an image or gif that represents the input images but in text format. Basically, it uses the RGB value in the image and converts it into a corresponding unique character. Currently, this project is still in the developed phase. This is inspired by the flipbook.

This project uses the AWT library to do the scanning.
